    title="Debugging a Dapp using Remix - Mist - Geth"
    content="The ultimate goal of this tutorial is to debug transactions that have been created by a dapp front end.

    It is easy in Remix to debug a transaction created from its own GUI. However, setting up an environment that allows you to debug transactions created outside of Remix, require a bit more of complexity.

    We will need four tools for that :

    Geth - this is the center piece and provides the blockchain environment. We will basically run geth in a dev mode.
    Mist - this is the Ethereum dapp browser. We will use it to browse our front end.
    Remix - this is the Ethereum IDE. We will use it to develop our Solidity contract.
    Any code editor you want - in order to write your front end :)"
